# Coordinate Reference Systems

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is *a coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities*.  A CRS can be applied locally, regionally, or globally.  A Cartesian grid (think graph paper) is a simple 2D coordinate reference system for referencing locations on the surface of a flat plane.  A spherical coordinate system (think latitude/longitude) is a more complex 2D coordinate system for referencing locations on the surface of a sphere.

## Learning Outcomes

This module is intended to give a broad overview of how we represent the 3D earth on 2D maps using coordinate reference systems.  Some of the things you can expect from this module:

* Steps of Abstraction: 3D Earth >>> 2D Map
    * Geoids
    * Datums
        * Local vs. Global
    * Geographic Coordinate Systems
    * Projected Coordinate Systems
* Types of Map Projectoins
* Map Scale
