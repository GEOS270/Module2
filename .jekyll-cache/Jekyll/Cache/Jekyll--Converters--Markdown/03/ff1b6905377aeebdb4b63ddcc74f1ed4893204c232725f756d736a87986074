<p>We are going to replicate one of the foundational studies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology">Epidemiology</a> and the closely related field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_geography">Health Geography</a> using modern GIS techniques.  I introduced why this study is important discuss the context of why this is important in <a href="Content_Part1_3.md">lecture</a>.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-a-project">Setting up a Project</h1>
<p>If you have an ArcPro windows open from the previous step, you can save and close them.  We‚Äôll open a new instance of ArcPro for this part.  When ArcPro opens choose the Map under Blank Templates as shown below.  Then create your new project.  I‚Äôve named mine Lab1_Project so I can easily identify it.  This will be the name of the folder your project is saved in.  Set the location to an appropriate workspace.  I am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is ‚ÄúC:\GEOG270\2021_S1\Labs‚Äù.  This is the location where the project folder will be reside.  If you are working on a lab computer, you should put your project in C:\temp.  It is <strong>very important</strong> to familiarize yourself with the procedures for <a href="https://june-skeeter.github.io/GEOS270W2/docs/Labs.html#saving-your-work">saving your work</a> if you are working on a lab computer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with.  Once you set up a new project, close ArcGIS Pro for now.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="download-data">Download Data</h1>
<p>Lets download the data we need and put it in the Lab1_Project folder you just created.  Click the download button below.  If a pop up appears, choose save, the file will be saved in the downloads folder.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/June-Skeeter/Module1_GEOS270/raw/main/data/CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb.zip" class="btn btn-blue">Download</a></p>

<h2 id="extract-the-data">Extract the Data</h2>
<p>Open the windows file explorer (folder on bottom ribbon or search the start menu).  Navigate to the downloads folder.  You will see a folder called ‚ÄúCholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb‚Äù, note the type ‚ÄúCompressed (zipped) Folder‚Äù and size 11709 KB.  Right click on the CholeraOutbreak_1854.gdb, choose a zip file manager, and select ‚ÄúExtract files‚Äù.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zip files (.zip) are a method for compressing data so it can be stored and transfered more efficiently.  However, to work with the data, we have to extract it.</li>
  <li>On my computer, the 7-Zip is the .zip file manager.  If you are working on the geography department computers, you can uses PeaZip instead.  The specific options might differ, but the general principal is the same.</li>
</ul>
