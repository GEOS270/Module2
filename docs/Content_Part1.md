# Steps of Abstraction

The Earth is a lumpy ball of rock careening through space.  It is far too complicated to represent fully; [you can't view more than half of the 3D earth at once when viewing it on a 2D plane](https://earth.google.com/web/@36.52273887,-99.26765628,-16448.90405368a,22268202.74494887d,35y,-0h,0t,0r).  We need to create abstractions to simplify the shape of the earth so we can map it in 2D.
