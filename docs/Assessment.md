### Written Answers 

Written answers can be brief but they should adequately answer the question.

* Bullet point format is okay **unless otherwise specified**

### File Submissions

Map/charts/figures will be evaluated for completeness and aesthetics.

* Files should be saved as using the file type specified (.pdf, .png, etc.)
    * Make sure to double check the file before uploading!

## Part 2: Comparing the Projections

[**11)**](docs/Application_Part2.md#four-ways-to-display-canada) Submit your figure showing Canada in the four different coordinate systems.

[**12)**](docs/Application_Part2.md#four-ways-to-display-canada) Write a **paragraph or two** comparing and contrasting the four different coordinate systems.  What are the differences/similarities between them?  If you wanted to make a map of population totals by province, which coordinate system(s) would you choose? What if you wanted to make a map of population **density** by province, which coordinate system(s) would you choose?

[**13)**](docs/Application_Part2.md#one-way-you-cant-display-canada) Why doesn't the UTM projection work well for displaying the whole country of Canada?  Think back to what we discussed in lecture and what was presented in the tutorial.
