Questions are listed here with hyperlinks to the relevant section of the lab if you need help finding answers. ## Rubrics ### Written Answers Written answers should be brief but they should adequately answer the question. Bullet point format is sufficient unless otherwise specified. All written answers will be evaluated following this general rubric. * Scores & categories are general guides, you TA may assign scores between these levels * Your TA will provide brief comments where applicable, if you need more feedback you can follow up with your TA. |Score| Category | Details |-----|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|0% |Missing |N/A |40% |Insufficient |Minimal effort, missing major key points, or serious logical flaws|60% |Below Expectations |Missing a few key points or minor logical flaws |80% |Met Expectations |Hits key points and mostly well constructed |100% |Exceeds Expectations|Clearly thought out, concise, and astute | ### Map Submissions Maps will be evaluated for completeness following the rubric below. Later in term, maps will be evaluated for correctness and cartography. For now, as long as you can make a map with the necessary elements, you'll get full credit! |Score| Category | Details |-----|----------|-------------------------------------------------|0% |Missing |N/A |50% |Incomplete|Did not follow instructions, missing key elements|100% |Complete |Successfully made a map with required components | --- # Quiz Questions ## Part 1: Map Projections Tutorials ### Exercise 1 [**1)**](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise1-discover-coord.html#inspecting-the-metadata) Metadata is _____ about ____. ### Exercise 2 [**2)**](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise2-transform.html#exercise-2-projecting-on-the-fly) In your own words, what does Project “On the Fly” do? ### Exercise 3 [**3)**](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise3-project.html#exercise-3-project-your-data) What UTM zone is Vancouver in? * 10 S * 11 N * 10 N * 18 N [**4)**] Use the [What UTM Zone am I in?](https://mangomap.com/robertyoung/maps/69585/what-utm-zone-am-i-in-#) tool to match find the UTM zones for these cities: ### Exercise 4 [**5)**](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/map-projections/content/exercise4-pop-density.html#inspect-the-attribute-tables) What spatial unit is the Shape_Area of the CAN_albersEA in?

A CRS can be applied locally, regionally, or globally. A Cartesian grid (think graph paper) is a simple 2D coordinate reference system for referencing locations on the surface of a flat plane. A spherical coordinate system (think latitude/longitude) is a more complex 2D coordinate system for referencing locations on the surface of a sphere. Cartesian versus spherical, or geographic, coordinates. PostGIS. ",
