TOC {:toc} --- # Four Ways to Display Canada Create a figure showing Canada displayed using four different coordinate systems. Your submission should look something like the figure below, you can reference the video for help setting things up. The key components you need for full credit are: * Four maps on one sheet showing Canada displayed using the following coordinate systems: * WGS 1984 * Web Mercator * Canada Lambert Conformal Conic * Canada Albers Equal Area * Your name & date created * Map scale shown in **two** ways on each map * Scale text * Scale bar * A graticule showing lines of Latitude and Longitude * Use the same spacing (15 degrees) for each map --- # One Way You Can't Display Canada One final step! Re-open the **Vancouver UTM Z10** map and add the **CAN_WGS1984** layer, then zoom to the layer extent. Think about why this coordinate system can't display the whole country. Try adding the other Canada layers (eg. **CAN_albersEA**) to see if that fixes things. See the video below for guidance. Your browser does not support iframes. View Image in New Tab ",

Which layer do you think has the most accurate Population Density and why? ## Part 2: Comparing the Projections [**11)**](/Application_Part2.md#four-ways-to-display-canada) Submit your figure showing Canada in the four different coordinate systems. [**12)**](/Application_Part2.md#four-ways-to-display-canada) Write a **paragraph or two** comparing and contrasting the four different coordinate systems. What are the differences/similarities between them? If you wanted to make a map of population totals by province, which coordinate system(s) would you choose? What if you wanted to make a map of population **density** by province, which coordinate system(s) would you choose? [**13)**](/Application_Part2.md#one-way-you-cant-display-canada) Why doesn't the UTM projection work well for displaying the whole country of Canada?

It is a bit beyond the scope of this course, and nothing from this book will be on the exam (unless it was covered elsewhere in lecture), but it can serve as a helpful resource for building your conceptual model. ## Choosing a Projection Here is a simple summary to help you think though which class of map projection you might want to use. Categories in **bold** are the most common classes we use. | Projection Category | Properties | Common Uses | :------------- | :-------------: | -------------: | **Conformal** | Preserves local shapes and angles | Topographic maps, navigation charts, weather maps | **Equal Area** | Preserves areas | Dot density maps, thematic maps | Equidistant| Preserves distance from one or two specified points to all other points on the map | Maps of airline distances, seismic maps showing distances from an earthquake epicenter | True Direction | All directions are true from a single specified point (usually the center) to all other points on the map | Navigation and route planning maps | **Compromise** | No point is completely distortion free; distortion is minimized near the center and along the equator | World maps | ### Choosing a Projection: Flowchart ",

A CRS can be applied locally, regionally, or globally. A Cartesian grid (think graph paper) is a simple 2D coordinate reference system for referencing locations on the surface of a flat plane. A spherical coordinate system (think latitude/longitude) is a more complex 2D coordinate system for referencing locations on the surface of a sphere. ## Learning Outcomes This module is intended to give a broad overview of how we represent the 3D earth on 2D maps using coordinate reference systems. Some of the things you can expect from this module: * Steps of Abstraction: 3D Earth >>> 2D Map * Geoids * Datums * Local vs. Global * Geographic Coordinate Systems * Projected Coordinate Systems * Types of Map Projectoins * Map Scale ",
